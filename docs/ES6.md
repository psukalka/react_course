# Key mentions

## Array map function
- Operates on each element of the list (or array) and returns the output generated by applying map function on each element
```sh
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const items = colors.map(color => `<li>${color}</li>`)
console.log(items)
```

## Object Destructuring
- Many times it is required to extract multiple properties from an object. It becomes repetitive syntax. A better way to achieven same is: 
```sh
const address = {
	street: '',
	city: '',
	country: ''
}
const {street, city, country} = address;
```
- With this, we will have three variables that would have same name properties from original object
- If we need only `city` field, it should be accessed as: 
```sh
const {city} = address;
```
- If we need `street` field but should be renamed as `st` then: 
```sh
const {street: st} = address;
```

## Spread Operator
- Convenient way of operating arrays or objects
```sh
const first = [1,2,3]
const second = [4,5,6]

// No need to use concat operator
const combined = [...first, 'a', ...second, 'b', 'c']`
```

- Cloning objects
```sh
const first = {name: 'pvs'};

const clone = {...first}
```

## Inheritance
- Objects are created with `new` keyword
- In a child class, parent class constructor must be called with `super()` method


## Modules
- Objects defined in a module are private by default
- They can be exported with `exports` keyword
- **Class is technically an object in JS as it is a syntactic sugar over `constructor` function and functions are objects**
- `{}` braces are used to import named exports 
- default exports are imported directly
