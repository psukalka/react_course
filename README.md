# React

## What is React ? 
- JavaScript library for building fast UI 
- developed at FB in 2011

## Architecture
- At the heart are components
- At least one component (called Root component) in each application
- Read more [here](./docs/component.md)

## Angular vs React
- Similar in component based architecture
- But `Angular` is a framework with complete solution while `React` is a library that only takes care of rendering the View and making sure that it is in sync with `state`
- Hence, React has a very small API to learn
- This also means you need to depend on other libraries for routing, calling HTTP services, ... Thus, you have freedom to choose what you need rather than being fixed with a framework (good or bad, decide for yourself)
